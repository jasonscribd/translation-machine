## üìñ Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Configure API Key**: Click the Settings button and enter your OpenAI API key
2. **Upload File**: Drag and drop or select a TXT, PDF, or EPUB file
3. **Choose Settings**: Select your target language, AI model, and translation style
4. **Review Cost**: Check the estimated tokens and cost before starting
5. **Translate**: Click "Start Translation" to begin
6. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time progress and preview the translation
7. **Export**: Download your translated document as TXT or DOCX

### AI Models Available

- **GPT-4o Mini**: Most cost-effective option ($0.150 per 1M input tokens)
- **GPT-4o**: Balanced performance and cost ($2.50 per 1M input tokens)  
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Highest quality ($10.00 per 1M input tokens)

### Translation Styles

- **Formal**: Professional, business-appropriate tone
- **Conversational**: Natural, friendly tone
- **Academic**: Scholarly tone with precise terminology
- **Creative**: Adaptive translation with cultural context
- **Technical**: Maintains technical accuracy and terminology
- **Custom**: Write your own system prompt

### Chunking

Large documents are automatically split into chunks to:
- Avoid API token limits
- Provide better error recovery
- Enable progress tracking
- Allow pause/resume functionality

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage**: Your API key is stored only in your browser's local storage
- **No Server**: Everything runs client-side, no data sent to our servers
- **Direct API**: Translations go directly from your browser to OpenAI
- **Open Source**: Full transparency - inspect the code yourself

## üåê Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers supported

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### File Processing
- **TXT**: Direct text reading
- **PDF**: Text extraction (currently basic implementation)
- **EPUB**: Text extraction from EPUB structure

### Token Estimation
Uses a rough approximation of 1 token ‚âà 4 characters for cost estimation. Actual usage may vary slightly.

### Error Handling
- Automatic retry for rate limits
- Graceful handling of API errors
- Progress preservation for interrupted translations
